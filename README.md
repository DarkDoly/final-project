# final-project
Hello! My name is Max! and this is Agu-Game!

Disclaimer, it is partially incomplete, i had a rough time figuring out Arduino, so I wasnt able to get everything I wanted in there, and not Arduino code either.

However! I do want to talk about the game itself! 

My original vision for the game was Agumon and his transformation into his big buddy, Greymon!

(I wanted to create animation classes for fireballs that destroyed the evil bitGumon, but never got the time to do it.)

Instead, I opted for agumon to come into contact with bitgumon to increase his score!

After score reaches 20, Agumon transforms into Greymon! and gets double points with a larger hitbox!

Your goal is to rack up the largest score in the span of 60 seconds with these mechanics in mind.

I enjoyed the project, and if I had plans for any future development, I would focus on messing more around with the sound and I would definitely add an Arduino component.

Thank you for reading!
